.TH pekka-kana-2 "6" "February 2019" "Pekka Kana 2"
.SH NAME
pekka-kana-2 \- (Pekka Kana 2) is an oldschool 2D platformer where you control a rooster called Pekka.
.br
Your mission is to save Pekka's chicken friends from an evil crow.
.PP
.SH HISTORY
.br
.B == Rooster Island 1 ==
.br
Pekka is a rooster that lives in a farm in far away land called Finland.
.br
Pekka's job at the farm is to guard a henhouse full of (surprise!) chickens.
.br
Everything goes nice and peacefully, until one night...
.PP
Something terrible happens: Someone steals all the chickens!
.br
And that someone is a wicked and crooked minded crow called "The Evil One" (a one spooky bird).
.br
Now, Pekka has to save all the stolen chickens and bring them back.
.br
And yes, to kick one ugly crow butt from here to infinity...
.PP
But it won't be easy! The Evil One (friends call him Evil) has a horrible mind-bending device that he uses to control his army of hypnotized animals.
.br
They are also victims of The Evil One, but as long as Evil One has them, they are your enemies.
.br
.PP
.B == Rooster Island 2 ==
.br
The plot thickens! After saving the chickens it becomes obvious why The Evil One kidnapped Pekka's friends in the first place.
.br
Chicken brains are for some reason immune to The Evil One's mind bending device!
.br
Pekka also finds out (with his tiny brains) that Evil One has also been experimenting with strange voodoo magics and gene manipulation.
.br
But that's not all! Rumours tell, that The Evil One is finishing prototypes of a new kind of world domination weapon.
.br
It is called "The Metal Hen"! Together these horrifying robots are capable of launching a world wide mind-bending wave, that even the chickens can not escape!
.br
Once again you must stop The Evil One from taking over the world! And if you tought it was difficult last time - now it really gets ugly...
.br
Oh, and did I mention - he kidnapped your friends again. Isn't he just evil?
.br
.SH HOW TO PLAY
.br
.PP
.B GAME'S GOAL
.br
The game consists of episodes and episodes consists of levels.
.br
To complete an episode you must complete all the levels by finding an exit in each one of them.
.br
Sometimes there is a time limit that you must not exceed. There are no lives so you can try as many times as you want.
.br
Each level has its own hiscore and best lap time. After each level your score is counted to see if you played better than the last time.
.br
The more bonuses you collect and the more enemies you knock out, the higher score you'll get.
.br
You also get extra bonuses for remaining energy, items and time. Each level's score is added to your total score.
.br
To become a new episode champion, you must break the episode's hiscore.
.br
You can save your game anytime you like, but only your total score and your current position on the map will be stored.
.br
.PP
.B CONTROLS
.br
You can use keyboard or gamepad to move Pekka. In menus you can also use mouse to control the cursor.
.br
Here's a list of things Pekka can do.
